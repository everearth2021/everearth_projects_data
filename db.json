A contour study for minimising the cutting and filling and plotting the winding road with minimum ramp slope of 1:10 was done which accessed each plot from the lower and the higher contour. A 2nd scheme of 10 vacation apartments Ground and 1 floor above, is designed on a sloping site with all amenities along with the club house water bodies restaurants along with infrastructure for the same. These 10 apartments are located on a slope of not more than 1:5 and along the natural contour lines. The higher slopes which are non buildable have elevated wooden walkways along natural contour and trees such that it makes the non-accessible more accessible and inviting. The Cottages are designed in response to the natural topography and contours with winding road accessing each of them. Dedicated golf cart service to shuttle people from main parking to their individual cottages",
